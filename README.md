The content presented here explores machine learning's models to decrease the loss due to late check outs.

notebooks_datasets\delay_eda.ipynb -- Make a Cancel Risks and its weight on the company losses. 

dashboard\dashboard_app.py -- gives excellents insights about delay/ cost predictions : 
please execute on your terminal:

streamlit run .\dashboard_app.py

api\app.py -- on api folder returns a predicted value (XGBoost model) and retruns a json.file on FAST API .
